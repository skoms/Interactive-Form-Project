## Introduction
This project is to functionally set up a Registration form, which is supposed to be validated once you press 'Register', and is also designed to be accessible regardless of dissability.


### Comments
I decided to add instant feedback on the 'Card Number', 'Zip Code', and 'CVV' fields. Reason is I believe these are the fields that are the most important to pay attention to, as it falls under the 'Payment' category.
