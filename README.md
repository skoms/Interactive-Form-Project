## Introduction
This project is to functionally set up a Registration form, which is supposed to be validated once you press 'Register', and is also designed to be accessible regardless of dissability.


### Comments
I decided to add real-time feedback on the 'Card Number', 'Zip Code', and 'CVV' fields. Reason is I believe these are the fields that are the most important to pay attention to, as it falls under the 'Payment' category.

In addition, I have added conditional error messages to 4 fields: 'email', 'card number', 'zip code', and 'cvv'.
For the email, I made custom error messages and validation for whether the field was empty, and whether the user remembered the '@' symbol. For the three fields for the credit card payement, I check and return custom messages on whether the field is empty or if they have typed anything but numbers.
